# NutriCow

By 2050, the global population is expected to reach 10 Billion and 11 Billion by 2100 as per UN Food and Agriculture organization and in order to feed the world food requirement by the year 2050 is expected to double that of 2010. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the global dairy sector is comprised of one billion people, with 600 million living on dairy farms and another 400 million whose livelihoods depend on dairy providing nutritious food comprising many of the macro- and micronutrients to six billion people around the world with an increase of demand upto 74% by 2050. Dairy farms represent 20% of global agricultural lands and dairy products provide five percent of total energy consumed, including 10% of protein and nine percent of fat in the average humanâ€™s diet.
Despite dairy sector being a strong contributor in meeting global food demand, the sector poses several productivity, environmental and resource utilization challenges mainly due to lack of customized region specific balance feed formulation resulting in resource wastage, lower yield per cattle, increase cost of production and higher Greenhouse gas emissions. The major factors are adoption of traditional ration formulation practices and lack of knowledge due to complex chemical composition of feedstuff ingredients to map with nutritional requirements of specific cattle.
NutriCow is a farmer centric data driven platform to formulate least cost balanced ration using IBM AI Services, IBM Object Storage to meet the nutritional requirement of bovine in terms of energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals with a aim to achieve sustainable food security and circular bio economy.
Key Value propositions:
1.	Data-Driven Ration Formulation: NutriCow takes the guesswork out of creating cattle rations. Farmers input details about their available raw materials, such as types of crops, grains, and forage, along with their nutritional profiles. The platform's algorithms then analyze this data and calculate the optimal ration to meet specific nutritional requirements for different growth stages and production goals.
2.	Cost Optimization: Beyond nutrition, NutriCow helps farmers minimize costs by suggesting alternatives for raw materials based on market prices and availability. This cost optimization feature ensures that farmers achieve maximum yield while staying within budget constraints.
3.	Real-time Updates and Monitoring: NutriCow provides real-time monitoring of cattle performance. Farmers can track milk production, weight gain, and overall health indicators. Any deviations from expected performance trigger alerts, allowing timely interventions to ensure herd well-being.
4.	Inventory Management: To prevent shortages or excess inventory, NutriCow includes an inventory management component. Farmers can monitor their available resources and receive alerts when it's time to replenish certain ingredients.
5.	Sustainability Insights: Our platform offers valuable sustainability insights by quantifying the environmental impact of different ration formulations. This empowers farmers to make choices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower water usage, and decrease the overall ecological footprint of their operations.
As such we hope by adopting NutriCow the dairy farmers will be equipped to improve on their feed efficiency, increase in farm productivity, better informed decision making thereby ensuring overall sustainability in production and combating greenhouse gas emissions from the sector.
